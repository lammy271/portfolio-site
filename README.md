# Anny Long Portfolio Website

This is a website meant to show off my resume and design portfolio to the world.



# Background

The website currently uses [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/) for smooth animations.



# Contributing

This project has two main branches: `main` and `dev`.

- `main` contains the production code that users will see on the website, hosted by Cloudflare Pages.

- All changes should be done in `dev` first, where they can be previewed on a local machine before being pushed onto the public-facing website. Once tested and stable, changes made to `dev` can then be merged into `main`.
