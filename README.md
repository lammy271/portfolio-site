# Anny Long Portfolio Website

This is a website meant to show off my resume and design portfolio to the world.

# Background

The website uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for its icons and [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/) for smooth animations.

# Contributing

This project has two main branches: `main` and `dev`.

- `main` contains the production code that reflects what users see on [the website](https://annylongdesign.com/), hosted by Cloudflare Pages.

- `dev` contains a test build of the website, where changes can be previewed [at this link](https://dev.portfolio-site-a5x.pages.dev/) before being pushed onto the public-facing website.

All changes should be made in `dev` first. Once those changes are tested, they can be compiled into a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and [merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) into `main`.
