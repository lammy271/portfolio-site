# Anny Long Portfolio Website

This is a website meant to show off my resume and design portfolio to the world.

# Background

The website currently uses [motion.dev](https://motion.dev/) for smooth animations.

# Contributing

This project has two main branches: `main` and `dev`.

- `main` contains the production code that users will see on [the website](https://annylongdesign.com/), hosted by Cloudflare Pages.

- All changes should be done in `dev` first, where they can be previewed on a local machine before being pushed onto the public-facing website.

Once tested and stable, changes made to `dev` can then be compiled into a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and [merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) into `main`.
