	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I believe in the power of simplicity in design. I create meaningful connections between people, products, and services through a user-centered approach. Collaboration energizes me—I love exploring new ideas and transforming abstract concepts into practical solutions for developers. Beyond artistic direction, I’m always thinking of the end user to create sustainable design. Through my experience working with larger teams, I've learned to effectively bridge communication between engineers, designers, and other team members to bring ideas to life.</p>
